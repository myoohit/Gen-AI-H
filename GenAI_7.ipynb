leverage artificial intelligence (AI) to perceive their environment.\nThey make informed decisions and execute actions to achieve specific goals.\nThese agents can operate independently or collaboratively.\nThey interact with other agents and complex systems to accomplish intricate tasks.\nDesigned to simulate human-like intelligence, AI agents possess the capacity to solve complex problems.\nThey adapt to dynamic changes and continuously learn from accumulated experience.\nThey employ a diverse range of AI techniques, including machine learning algorithms.\nThey use natural language processing for understanding and generating human language.\nThey use computer vision for interpreting visual data.\nTheir applications are rapidly expanding.\nThey encompass virtual assistants and chatbots that provide personalized support.\nThey include self-driving cars and autonomous vehicles that navigate complex traffic scenarios.\nThey involve robotic systems that automate industrial processes.\nThey include intelligent systems that optimize resource allocation.\nKey challenges in the development of AI agents involve ensuring safety and reliability.\nThey also involve addressing ethical considerations surrounding their decision-making processes.\nAnd achieving robust performance in unpredictable and dynamic environments.\nOngoing research focuses on creating agents that are not only intelligent but also reliable.\nThey should also be explainable and beneficial.\nThis ensures their seamless and responsible integration into diverse sectors of society.\nAI agents are increasingly used in healthcare for diagnostics and personalized treatment.\nThey are used in finance for fraud detection and algorithmic trading.\nThey are used in education for personalized learning experiences.\nThey are used in entertainment for creating interactive content.\nThe development of AI agents requires careful consideration of their impact on society.\nIt is important to establish guidelines for their ethical use.\nThis includes addressing issues of bias and fairness in their algorithms.\nAnd ensuring that they are transparent and accountable.\nThe future of AI agents holds immense potential for innovation and progress.\nIt is crucial to develop them responsibly and ethically.\n\"\"\"\n\nsummary = summarizer(long_text, max_length = 150, min_length = 50, do_sample =
